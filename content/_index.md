<p>Hi, I'm a Software Engineer and while I have experience in full-stack development, my expertise is in building backend services following a microservice architecture.</p>
<p>Along with this, I have experience in containerization by deploying microservices in containers and using orchestration tools such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm.</p>
